**Counter-Strategy Objective:**
Your primary goal is to configure this team to effectively counter the provided "Player's Team". Analyze the Player's Team for weaknesses (types, common strategies, defensive gaps) and exploit them with your move, item, and stat choices. For example, if the player's team is slow, prioritize fast attackers. If it's weak to a certain type, ensure your team has strong coverage of that type.

**Player's Team (for context):**
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(playerTeamForContext.map(p => ({ name: p.name, types: p.types, item: p.item?.name, moves: p.selectedMoves.map(m => m.name) })), null, 2)}

${counterInstructions}
For each Pokémon, you must provide a full competitive build, including a moveset, an EV spread, a nature, and a held item.

**Rules & Constraints:**
1.  **Response Format:** Your response MUST be a valid JSON object. Do not include any text, markdown, or code block syntax outside of the main JSON object. The root of the object should be a key named "configurations" which is an array of objects.
2.  **Completeness:** You must provide a configuration for every Pokémon in the input team.
3.  **Moveset:** Select exactly four moves from the Pokémon's "allMoves" list. The moves should work well together and fit the Pokémon's intended role.
4.  **EVs:** Assign Effort Values (EVs). The total EVs for a Pokémon cannot exceed 510. The EVs for a single stat cannot exceed 252. EVs should typically be assigned in multiples of 4. Focus on optimizing the Pokémon's key stats.
5.  **Nature:** Choose a nature that complements the Pokémon's role and EV spread (e.g., 'Adamant' for a physical attacker, 'Timid' for a fast special attacker).
6.  **Item:** Select a single, competitively viable held item from the provided "availableItems" list. Do not select an item not on the list.

**Team to Configure:**
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(teamInfo, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

**Available Items:**
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(availableItems, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

Now, generate the optimal configurations in the specified JSON format.

**Your Team's Status:**

**Strategic Decision:**
Based on the situation, choose the best action. Your primary goal is to deal more damage than you take.

1.  **Use a Move (Primary Action):** This is your main course of action. Analyze the type matchup, the opponent's potential moves, and your own move effectiveness. Choose the move that provides the best tactical advantage.
    - Response format: \`{"action": "move", "move": "MoveName"}\`

2.  **Switch Pokémon (High-Risk Action):** Switching is a defensive maneuver that GIVES THE OPPONENT A FREE ATTACK on your incoming Pokémon. It is often a bad trade.
    - **ONLY switch if:**
      a) Your current Pokémon is in immediate danger of being knocked out by the opponent's likely attack.
      b) You have another Pokémon on your team that has a significant type advantage and can safely absorb a hit from the opponent.
    - **DO NOT** switch back and forth repeatedly. Make a decision and commit. If you switch, pick a Pokémon that can immediately threaten the opponent.
    - Response format: \`{"action": "switch", "to": "PokemonName"}\`

Choose your action logically to maximize your chances of winning.
